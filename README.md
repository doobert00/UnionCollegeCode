Code from select classes while studying at Union College.

# Operating Systems
  - Course Code: CSC-335.
  - Contains code from two projects in my operating systems course.
  - The first project is individual work on a linked list, shared buffer,
  mutex locks, semaphores, and condition variable implementations.
  - The second project is a group project. I developed:
    - Syscalls: read, write, open, close, dup2
    - Components: File table

  game KAMI3.

# Parallel Computing
  - Course Code: CSC-333
  - Contains code from 6 projects assigned in my parallel computing course,
  also called high performance computing.
  - All of these projects were individual. Some were given with starter code.

# Research
  - Contains my research at Union College, supervised by Professor Matt Anderson.
  - SeniorThesis contains the .tex code for the SeniorThesis.pdf final thesis paper.
  - WA_Thmm_Sage is the Sage Math implementation of my thesis.
  - Zach_Dubinsky_Research_Report.pdf is a research report of my work during Summer
  2021.

# System Architecture
  - Course Code: CSC-270
  - Contains labs from my system architecture course.
  - Developed CPU model using Logism and completed labs in MIPS assembly.
  - Final project was to complete the labs again using ARM assembly with no
  starter code.
