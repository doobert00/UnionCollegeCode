## Notes

* It's neat that you added markdown formatting to your printf statements to gather data, but it makes the data more readable if you have multiple columns.  If each row contains a vector size and each column is num processors, then it's easier to view and analze speedups.

* you're not taking the square root of the accumulated sums
