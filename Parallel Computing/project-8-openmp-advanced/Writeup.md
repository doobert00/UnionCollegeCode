- Matrix Addition
  - With dynamic allocation we get consistent speedup as the number of processors increases for larger matrix sizes. For smaller matrix sizes there is probably cache coherence issues that make the program slow down. This is made evident by 100-by-100 matrices and large block sizes. This does perform better than static generally, see static for more.

  - Static allocation performs similarly to dynamic speedup with respect to the cache coherence issue. For larger array sizes it does not perform as well as dynamic scheduling, presumably because dynamic scheduling allows other threads to start a new task before all threads are finished with their own.

- Transposition
  - Transposition performs does not seem to get speedups so I think there may be a problem with my algorithm. Static scheduling shares this problem so I think there may be a problem with my algorithm. Assuming there is not, static scheduling performs much better than dynamic, especially as the chunk size increases.

  - Static scheduling has the same problems as dynamic but it does run a little faster in general. I think dynamic scheduling causes more cache coherence problems and it is easier to run the algorithm if all cores are on the same pace.
