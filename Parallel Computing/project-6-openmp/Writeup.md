- [ ] Remarks on omp_vectors.c:
  - The sqrt() function was not working when compiling with the makefile. After some investigation, it was putting the -lm flag after the -fopenmp flag. This didn't work with a normal gcc compile, but everything worked when I gcc compiled normally and put the -lm flag at the end.
  - I'm not sure why more threads didn't change the time when there were greater than 5 of them. I imagine there is either something wrong with my code or it is a hardware thing. I am doubtful of the former since there isn't much code to be wrong.

- [ ] OMP Vector Add
  - At the maximum array size more threads gave generally consistent speedup for 1, 2, 3, and 4 threads. 5 threads was slightly slower than 4. 6 or more threads was slightly faster than 6 or fewer threads, but the elapsed time stayed roughly stagnant with an increase in threads.
