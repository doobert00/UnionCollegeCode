Git Usage and Project Structure (11/20)
---------------------------------------

-5: commit messages often don't say what changes you made.

Fixes to allow code to work for my testing:

-2: Moved ZachGraphTests to the proper directory and package

-2: Changed GraphFactory to match requirements: 

1. Return type should be Graph, not ZachGraph.

2. You don't need to create GraphFactory objects in your tests in order to call the static method.
